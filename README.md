Installation
------------
There are 3 ways of running `ili: from this website, using an http server, or as a Chrome App.

Input
------------
`ili takes two files: 
* PNG and CSV for 2D mapping (the format and examples to be added here soon)
* STL and CSV for 3D mapping (the format and examples to be added here soon)

How to use
------------
`ili can be used for 
* showing molecular maps (Ctrl/Cmd-up or -down)
* searching for a molecular map by the name substring by Ctrl-f
* adjusting visualizaiton of a map including colors, scaling, hotspot removal using quantile thresholding
* interactive visualization in 2D using mouse (zoom by wheeling, zoom into particular region by click-and-wheeling)
* interactive visualization in 3D using mouse (rotate by dragging, zoom by wheeling)
* saving the rendering as PNG by Ctrl-s (in Win/Lin) or Cmd-s (in Mac)
